Executive Summary  \n\nDelhi, the capital of India, consistently ranks among the world’s most polluted megacities. From 2020 to 2024, the city’s fine‑particle (PM₂.₅) concentrations remained well above the World Health Organization (WHO) guideline of 10 µg m⁻³ (annual mean) and the Indian standard of 20 µg m⁻³. Seasonal spikes—especially during winter (November–February)—are driven by a combination of meteorological stagnation, vehicular emissions, construction dust, and agricultural burning in the surrounding states.  \n\nKey findings:  \n\n| Parameter | 2023 Annual Mean | 2022 Annual Mean | WHO 2021 Guideline | Indian Standard |\n|-----------|------------------|------------------|--------------------|-----------------|\n| PM₂.₅ (µg m⁻³) | 120 | 140 | 10 | 20 |\n| PM₁₀ (µg m⁻³) | 210 | 240 | 20 | 40 |\n| NO₂ (ppb) | 35 | 38 | 40 | 40 |\n| O₃ (ppb) | 70 | 75 | 100 | 100 |\n| AQI (average) | 210 | 240 | 50 | 100 |\n\n*Source: Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) 2024 Annual Report; WHO 2021 Air Quality Guidelines.*\n\nDespite a modest decline in 2023, Delhi’s air quality remains “unhealthy” or “very unhealthy” for most of the year. The 2022 “Delhi smog” event (peak PM₂.₅ > 400 µg m⁻³) highlighted the city’s vulnerability to episodic pollution spikes.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Methodology  \n\n1. **Data Sources**  \n   - **CPCB National Air Quality Monitoring Network (NAQMN)** – 18 fixed stations across Delhi (e.g., Safdarjung, Hauz Khas).  \n   - **Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC)** – supplementary local monitoring.  \n   - **WHO Air Quality Guidelines (2021)** – reference thresholds.  \n   - **Indian Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC)** – national standards.  \n   - **Satellite‑derived aerosol optical depth (AOD)** from MODIS for spatial context.  \n\n2. **Parameters Analyzed**  \n   - Particulate matter: PM₂.₅, PM₁₀.  \n   - Gaseous pollutants: NO₂, SO₂, CO, O₃.  \n   - Air‑Quality Index (AQI) – Indian standard (0–500).  \n\n3. **Time Frame**  \n   - Annual averages (2020‑2024).  \n   - Monthly trends (2023).  \n   - Peak‑event analysis (2022 winter smog).  \n\n4. **Limitations**  \n   - Data gaps due to station downtime (e.g., 2021 COVID‑19 lockdown).  \n   - Lack of real‑time satellite validation for 2024",
